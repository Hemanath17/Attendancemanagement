This program was developed to maintain and record the daily attendance of each and every students once when their respective Training images have been uploaded in the specific folder in order to training the model.

Not only this Program will record the Attendance including the Roll number, It also records  the time on which the student's face is visible on the webcam.
If the student was away from the screen during the class then it will not be marked in the attendance csv file.
